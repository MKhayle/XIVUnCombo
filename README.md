# XIVUncombo 

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/R6R2F1EYP)

This plugin splits combos and mutually exclusive abilities onto several buttons. For example, a 1-1-1 combo would become 1-2-3.
Thanks daemitus for the initial fork used for this, attick for the original XIVCombo plugin, Meli for the initial start, and obviously goat for making any of this possible.

## About
XIVUncombo is a plugin to disable "one-button" combo chains, as well as implementing various unassignable skills under the guise of BLU spells. 

For some jobs, this adds a massive amount of hotbar bloating (looking at you, VPR). For most, it adds a lot of mindless tedium associated with having to press various buttons that you'll end up understanding why they shouldn't be separate.

## Installation
* Compile it, or wait for it to be approved as a main repo plugin.
* If it does happen, just type `/xlplugins` in-game to access the plugin installer and updater. Any releases on this github page have been removed to facilitate proper installation going forward.
## In-game usage
* Type `/puncombo` to pull up a GUI for editing active uncombo replacements.
* Drag the named abilities from your BLU Spellbook onto your hotbar to use.
  * For example, to use AST's Minor Arcana Lord of Crowns feature, first check the box, then place Loom on your bar from your BLU Spellbook. It should automatically turn into Lord of Crowns.
  * The description associated with each uncombo should be enough to tell you which ability needs to be placed on the hotbar.

## Known Issues
* VPR is a mess, I'll organize it once I'll know how to read tooltips!
